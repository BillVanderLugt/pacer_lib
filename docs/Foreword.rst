#. Please note that you will have to `register for your own PACER account 
   <http://www.pacer.gov/register.html>`_ before you can download any documents
   from PACER (case-search only account is sufficient). The creators and 
   maintainers of *pacer_lib* are in no way responsible for any charges you may 
   incur on the PACER website as a result of using *pacer_lib*. You are also 
   responsible for making sure that your use of  *pacer_lib* complies with 
   PACER's terms of service. **This library is provided as-is and you use it at 
   your own risk.**

#. If you are looking for alternatives to accessing PACER directly, you
   could consider using `RECAP <http://www.recapthelaw.org>`_ or `Bloomberg Law
   <http://about.bloomberglaw.com>`_. You may be able to find ways to use 
   *pacer_lib* to organize and parse output from these alternatives, but we do
   not provide any support for output from these systems as we haven't used 
   these systems ourselves.
