09/18/2007,233,"ORDER. The Court has considered the proposals of certain parties for so-called ""threshold motions."" It is not satisfied that any of these proposed motions offers a sufficient prospect of advancing the efficient and timely resolution of this matter to justify their filing prior to determination of summary judgment motion(s). Accordingly, none shall be filed prior to the disposition of all summary judgment motions absent leave of Court. In addition, the Court will not entertain separate motions to strike on evidentiary grounds evidence submitted in support of and in opposition to motions for summary judgment.

03/16/2010,245,"ORDER. 1. Case Nos. 04 Civ. 0047 (LAK) and 04 Civ. 0367 (LAK) were brought as securities class actions and consolidated with No. 04 Civ. 0030 (LAK), which has been settled. Accordingly, the Clerk shall close these cases. 2. In No. 04 Civ. 9771 (LAK), (a) the Court granted the motion of defendants Grant Thornton International and Grant Thornton LLP (collectively, ""GT"") for summary judgment dismissing the complaint, (b) the action was dismissed on consent as against Deloitte & Touche S.p.A., Dianthus, S.p.A., Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, Deloitte & Touche LLP and Deloitte & Touche USA LLP, and (c) a default judgment was entered against Grant Thornton S.p.A., thus leaving for resolution only the question of damages against Grant Thornton S.p.A. As it would be inefficient to proceed with a damages inquest on the default judgment before plaintiffs appeal from the judgment dismissing as to GT is resolved, this case is stayed and transferred to the suspense docket pending further order of the Court. The Clerk shall close it for administrative purposes. 3. No. 06 Civ. 0383 (LAK) was dismissed as to all defendants save Grant Thornton S.p.A. as to which no proof of service ever was filed. The action is dismissed as to Grant Thornton S.p.A. for failure to prosecute. The Clerk shall close the case. 4. Nos. 04 Civ. 8569 (LAK) and 04 Civ. 8611 (LAK) were opened in consequence of motions for partial withdrawal of the reference with respect to a Bankruptcy Code ยง 304 proceeding pending in the Bankruptcy Court for this district, 04 B 14268. The Section 304 proceeding now has been inactive since mid-2007. Accordingly, these cases are transferred to the suspense docket pending further order of the Court.
