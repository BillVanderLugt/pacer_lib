03/07/2005,44,"MEMORANDUM AND OPINION # 91321. Accordingly, the Court exercises its discretion in substituting the Cement Masons Trust in the place of the Investor Group as co-lead Plaintiff alongside Fein. In light of the preference that the PSLA expresses in favor of allowing lead plaintiffs to select their own counsel, 15 U.S.C. 78 u-4(a)(3)(B)(v), the Court similarly substitutes Lerach Coughlin Stoia Geller Rudman & Robbins LLP as co-lead counsel in the stead of Wolf Haldenstein Adler Freeman & Herz LLP. Mindful that disagreements may arise- and in fact, have already arisen-throughout this action, the Court reserves the right to modify this co-lead plaintiff structure in the event that litigation is stalled, expenses become unnecessarily duplicative or wasteful, or the structure becomes otherwise unmanageable. In the meantime, the action shall proceed as ""In re IAC/InteractiveCorp Securities Litigation"" under the Master File No. 04cv7447, with Fein and the Cement Masons Trust as co-lead plaintiffs and Schatz & Nobel, P.C. and Lerach Coughlin Stoia Geller Rudman & Robbins LLP as co-lead counsel.
