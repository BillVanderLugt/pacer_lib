04/17/2008,84,"MINUTES IN CHAMBERS ORDER on Defendants' Motion to Dismiss 71 held before Judge Philip S. Gutierrez: Before this Court is Defendants Motion to Dismiss. The Court heard oral argument on this motion on April 14, 2008. The Court GRANTS-IN-PART Defendants Motion to Dismiss. Specifically, the Court finds that Plaintiffs securities fraud claim based on Defendants revenue projections in 2006 is barred because the projections are protected forward-looking statements under the PSLRA. Furthermore, the Court finds that Plaintiffs first claim against defendants Michaels, Buschur, and Edwards for violations of ยง 10(b) of the Exchange Act and SEC rule 10b-5 is insufficiently pled with particularity. Thus, the Court dismisses this claim against theindividual defendants, with leave to amend. If the Plaintiffs are able to plead claims against the individual defendants with the required particularity, they may filed a Second Amended Consolidated Complaint within ten days of the date of entry of this Order. However, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have adequately alleged a securities fraud claim against the corporate defendant based on Powerwaves 2005 financial reports. As a result, Plaintiffs second claim against the individual defendants for violations of ยง 20(a) survives.IT IS SO ORDERED.
