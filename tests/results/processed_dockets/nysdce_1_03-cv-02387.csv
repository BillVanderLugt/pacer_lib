12/03/2008,182,"ORDER; that Plaintiffs in these actions 04cv7900 and 05cv10206 have submitted to chambers, but not filed, two motions, each of which seeks a bar order with respect to potential claims ""for contribution, indemnification or reimbursement."" Each motion recites that such relief would be ""[i]n accordance with N.Y. Gen. Oblig. L. ยง 15-108. There are at least three problems with these motions that are listed in this Order. Finally, plaintiffs have offered no reason for the entry of a bar order if, as their motions imply, the proposed order would do nothing more than declare what in any event would be accomplished through the operation of N.Y. Gen. Oblig. L. ยง 15- 108. Accordingly, there is nothing before the Court upon which it should act and in any case no sufficient basis has been shown for taking the action requested (Signed by Judge Lewis A.
