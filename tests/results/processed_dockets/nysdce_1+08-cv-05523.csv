04/06/2009,118,"PRETRIAL ORDER NO. 7. By letter dated March 20, 2009, Mr. Trevor, counsel for plaintiffs in four actions removed from the California Superior Court and transferred to this Court, asks that he be appointed Liaison Counsel for the individual plaintiffs in the securities cases. That application is opposed by Mr. Molumphy, who points out the Mr. Trevor previously argued against the appointment of a single lawyer as Liaison Counsel for the individual plaintiffs and contends that if a single lawyer is to be appointed, it should be Mr. Molumphy. Neither Mr. Trevor nor Mr. Molumphy is likely to be reticent in advancing the interests of their own clients. Nor, I suspect, will the other counsel who represent plaintiffs who have brought their own actions. While it might well prove to be helpful if one or two lawyers would take the lead on behalf of the plaintiffs who have filed individual actions in presenting the views of such plaintiffs to Lead Counsel, I am confident that this will develop of its own accord. I therefore view the current contretemps as having more to do with titles that may be of use in other, unrelated litigations and other matters that are not of immediate concern. Accordingly, I decline these invitations. (Signed by Judge Lewis A.

04/24/2009,130,"PRETRIAL ORDER NO.9: Certain plaintiffs move to modify Pretrial Order NO.1 to permit them and their counsel to pursue as class claims certain claims that they have with respect to bonds of Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc. (""Lehman""), that were issued before February 13, 2007, and to appoint J. Allen Carney to the Executive Committee in this proceeding. The movants' arguments are singularly unpersuasive. The motion [09 MD 2017 docket item 61] is denied in all respects, substantially for the reasons set forth in the memoranda submitted by Lead Plaintiffs and the individual defendants. I add only two points. First, movants' assertion that their claims with respect to bond offerings preceding February 13, 2007 ""have, in effect, been abandoned"" (Movants' mem. 1) would be true if, and only if, movants' counsel is conceding that they have abandoned those claims. As they of course concede no such thing, the assertion is flatly incorrect. Nothing in Pretrial Order No.1 forecloses prosecution of those claims. While I enjoy good rhetoric as much as the next person, what separates good from bad rhetoric often is a connection between words and reality that makes the words ring true. That connection is missing here. Second, there is no need at this point to deal with movants' contention that they need not have complied with the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act provisions relating to class actions because their cases were commenced in state courts. There will be sufficient reason to do so in the event they seek class certification with respect to their claims in relation to pre-February 13, 2007 bond offerings. SO ORDERED.

The motion of Fred Mandell and Roy Wiegert to withdraw as plaintiffs and of Joseph Humble to intervene as a plaintiff[09 MD 2017, DI 669; 98 Civ. 5523, DI 311] is granted to the extent that Messrs. Mandell and Wiegert are permitted to withdraw and otherwise denied. Mr. Humble's application to intervene is untimely because his claim is barred by the statute of repose. Nor is there any basis in Rule 25 to substitute him as a party plaintiff (apart from intervention), as there has been no suggestion that there is any deceased plaintiff, let alon that Mr. Hubble is the personal representative or successor thereof. 2.

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, that: 1. This Order approving the proposed Plan of Allocation incorporates by reference the definitions in the Stipulation of Settlement and Release dated December 2, 2011 (the ""First Underwriter Stipulation"") and the Stipulation of Settlement and Release dated December 9, 2011 (the ""Second Underwriter Stipulation"") (together, the ""Stipulations"") and all terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the same meanings as set forth in the Stipulations or in the Notice. 2. The Court has jurisdiction to enter this Order approving the proposed Plan of Allocation, and over the subject matter of the Action and all parties to the Action, including all UW Settlement Class Members. 3. Notice of Lead Plaintiffs' motion for approval of the proposed Plan of Allocation was given to all UW Settlement Class Members who could be identified with reasonable effort and as further set forth in this order. 6. The Court hereby finds and concludes that the Plan of Allocation is, in all respects, fair and reasonable to the UW Settlement Class. As originally submitted, the Plan of Allocation provides for a $50 minimum distribution. The Court, however, reserves its determination on the amount of minimum distribution until its review of Lead Plaintiffs' later Motion to Distribute the Net Settlement Fund to Authorized Claimants. Accordingly, the Court hereby approves the Plan of Allocation proposed by Lead Plaintiffs, subject to such review of the minimum payment prior to the distribution. 7. There is no just reason for delay in the entry of this Order, and immediate entry by the Clerk of the Court is expressly directed. (Signed by Judge Lewis A.

The objections are overruled and the motion [DI 917] is denied. As these objections have been handled, at the parties' request, on an expedited basis and the parties have entreated the Court to rule promptly, preferably by August 1, the Court states only that it rules as it has, substantially for the reasons given in the R&R and at pages 16-20 of the response to Suntrust's objections. It nevertheless briefly emphasizes one point as further set forth within this Order. In this Court's view, Magistrate Judge Gorenstein was correct in concluding that the lawsuit and the arbitration, despite some inevitable overlap, do not share the identical factual predicate. If and to the extent that the Gimbel decisions are inconsistent with this view, and the Court expresses no view on that point, they would not be persuasive on the facts of this case..
